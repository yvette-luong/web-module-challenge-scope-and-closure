###---ANSWER-QUESTION---###

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).

<!-- //-Closure is the keys for development to manipulate functions: parent function level which already terminated can acess to its child. -->

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

<!-- CLOSURE : function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
  
<--Because it nested inside a parent function -->

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?

<!-- the output will display different numbers. The name will always be the same and the number will change -->

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`? 

<!--function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }  -->
